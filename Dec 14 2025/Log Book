Task: Compute kinetic and potential energies for MW+M31 snapshots using an approximate O(n log n) method
Time Spent: 4 hours (including code development and execution for one snapshot)
Objectives:
- Modify existing energy computation code to avoid O(n^2) scaling for potential energy.
- Implement a Barnes–Hut-like approximation using scipy.spatial.cKDTree.
- Add a progress tracker to monitor potential energy computation.
- Test the modified code on a single snapshot.

Actions Taken:
- Imported required libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scipy.spatial.cKDTree) and custom modules (ReadFile, CenterOfMass2).
- Implemented kinetic_energy function (unchanged).
- Replaced original double-loop potential energy computation with potential_energy_barnes_hut:
  * Uses cKDTree to query particle distances efficiently.
  * Computes pairwise gravitational potential energy while skipping self-interactions and already counted pairs.
  * Includes a progress tracker showing percent completion.
- Adjusted main loop to call the new potential energy function.
- Added progress messages for snapshot processing and potential energy computation.
- Ran code on one snapshot to verify correctness and functionality.

Observations/Results:
- Code ran successfully, producing kinetic energy, potential energy, and virial ratio for a snapshot.
- Progress tracker provides live feedback during computation.
- Total elapsed time (scripting + running snapshot) was ~4 hours.
- Approximation works correctly but is still computationally heavy for full snapshot sets.

Challenges:
- Even with O(n log n) scaling, runtime remains long due to high particle count.
- Processing all 802 snapshots sequentially would be impractical without further optimization.

Next Steps / Recommendations:
- Implement parallelized Barnes–Hut or particle-mesh (PM) method to reduce runtime.
- Consider subsampling particles for approximate virial ratio trends across snapshots.
- Explore dynamic progress bars with estimated remaining time for long computations.
- Log and visualize results for single snapshot before scaling up to full dataset.

Notes:
- Current code is a working prototype with progress tracking.
- Full analysis of all snapshots will require either HPC resources or additional algorithmic improvements.
