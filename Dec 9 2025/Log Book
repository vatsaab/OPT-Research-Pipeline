Hours time: 4 hours

Tasks accomplished:

Developed a Python script to compute the radial velocity dispersion profile of the combined Milky Way + M31 dark matter halo across all snapshots (000–801).

Implemented a velocity_dispersion_profile function to calculate σ(r) in logarithmic radial bins.

Integrated snapshot iteration with COM-centering and concatenation of MW and M31 particle positions and velocities.

Added a running counter to track the number of snapshots processed.

Outcome:

Successfully executed the code, processed all 802 snapshots.

Generated a heatmap showing the evolution of velocity dispersion as a function of radius and time.

Total runtime: 2600 seconds (~43 minutes).

File generated: VelocityDispersion.ipynb

Next Steps:

Compare velocity dispersion profiles to analytical estimators (e.g., Virial theorem, Wolf Mass estimator).

Incorporate error analysis and potential kernel smoothing for continuous profiles.
