Hours Worked: 5 hours

Tasks Completed:

Developed and refined a Python pipeline to analyze kinematic properties of the combined MW+M31 halo across snapshots 000–800.

Implemented COM-centering for both positions and velocities using the CenterOfMass2 module to ensure measurements are in the halo frame.

Computed tangential rotation velocities in spherical coordinates, allowing construction of the radial rotation curve for each snapshot.

Calculated specific angular momentum vectors and derived the Bullock spin parameter λ’ for the halo at each timestep.

Estimated escape speed profiles from the enclosed mass of the halo as a function of radius.

Added progress tracking with print statements for number of snapshots processed.

Ran the pipeline on all snapshots; processing took ~3100 seconds (~52 minutes).

Files Generated:

Notebook: HaloKinematics.ipynb

Plots saved as PNGs:

rotation_curve_matrix.png – Radial rotation velocity profile evolution across snapshots.

halo_spin_parameter.png – Evolution of the specific angular momentum and spin parameter.

escape_speed_profile.png – Escape speed as a function of radius for each snapshot.

Additional Notes:

The notebook includes well-commented code for reproducibility and clarity.

All plots were pushed to the repository, ensuring updated results are available for review.
