Hours Worked: 4.5 hours
Extended the pipeline to loop through multiple MW and M31 snapshots to track the time evolution of global halo axis ratios.
Implemented plotting features into the code. 
Moved all .tar files into the same directory on my system. 
Ran into errors documented in the Jupyter notebook "HaloShapeEvolution" that need debugging. Added a list of errors encountered in the file "Errors Encountered" within this folder. 
(A decent chunk of the time was spent troubleshooting the parsing of the .tar files. The errors are unresolved as of yet.)
