Parsing through the .tar files in my D drive seems to create an issue. 
Using the os module of python, I navigated to the folder containing the .tar files, but my code is failing to recognize snapshots MW_445.txt and M31_445.txt.
Those files are present in the relevant directory, so this might require some additional troubleshooting. Without being able to parse through the files, the code will not generate any plots. 
The files are too huge to be moved to my system's internal memory while maintaining adqueate functionality.
