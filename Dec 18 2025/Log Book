Project: MW–M31 Dark Matter Halo Shape Analysis

Duration: 8 hours (code development and documentation, creating the research write ups)

---

Summary of Work

Today’s work focused on extending the existing halo shape analysis pipeline beyond standard inertia-tensor methods. The objective was to retain literature-standard practice while introducing a novel, defensible methodology capable of capturing non-ellipsoidal structure during the MW–M31 merger.

Three deliverables were produced:

1. HaloShapeExtended.py
2. Novel halo shape methodology.pdf
3. Halo Shape Analysis: Extended Method.tex

Baseline Method Review

The starting point was the previously implemented mass-weighted inertia tensor analysis. This method computes global axis ratios (b/a, c/a) for the combined MW–M31 dark matter distribution as a function of snapshot number. It provides a standard, mass-based description of halo triaxiality and serves as a reference point for comparison with existing literature.

Before extending the pipeline, the logic, assumptions, and limitations of the inertia-tensor approach were carefully reviewed, particularly its reliance on an ellipsoidal approximation and its reduced sensitivity to tidal debris during major mergers.

Methodological Extension

The primary technical development today was the implementation of a convex hull–based geometric analysis. This approach treats the halo as a three-dimensional point cloud and characterizes its outer morphology without assuming symmetry, equilibrium, or ellipsoidal structure.

The extended analysis includes:

* Construction of the 3D convex hull of the particle distribution for each snapshot
* Measurement of the convex hull volume as a function of time
* Extraction of geometric axis ratios from the covariance of hull vertices
* Definition of a volume inflation factor comparing hull volume to an inertia-derived ellipsoidal volume

These quantities are designed to be directly comparable to inertia-tensor results while probing complementary physical information.

Code Development

A complete, standalone analysis script (HaloShapeExtended.py) was written. The script:

* Preserves the original inertia-tensor calculations
* Adds convex hull geometry using the same centered particle positions
* Processes all 801 simulation snapshots
* Produces time-series plots comparing mass-based and geometry-based shape diagnostics

Care was taken to keep the implementation modular and transparent so that the new methodology can be evaluated independently or removed without affecting the baseline analysis.

Documentation and Write-Up

A full methodology write-up was produced in LaTeX (Halo Shape Analysis: Extended Method.tex) and compiled into a PDF (Novel halo shape methodology.pdf). The write-up:

* Defines every technical term used in the analysis
* Justifies each methodological choice and its necessity
* Explains both the standard inertia-tensor approach and the extended convex-hull method
* Is structured to meet journal-level standards for a Methods section

The documentation is intended to be directly reusable in a manuscript or thesis without substantial revision.

Scientific Outcome

By the end of the session, the project now includes both:

* A literature-consistent mass-weighted halo shape diagnostic
* A novel, purely geometric diagnostic sensitive to merger-driven irregularities

Together, these tools provide a more complete and physically interpretable description of dark matter halo morphology during the MW–M31 merger than either method alone.

Next Steps

Planned follow-up work includes:

* Testing the code by running it on all the simualted snapshots available; documenting the results generated. 
* Validation of convex hull sensitivity to outliers and particle resolution
* Optional extension to concave (alpha-shape) analyses
* Integration of results into the broader merger evolution narrative
