Project: RNAAS Manuscript on MW–M31 Halo Shape Evolution

Objective:
Finalize and prepare a Research Note for RNAAS on the evolution of the Milky Way–Andromeda (MW–M31) halo system, comparing mass-weighted inertia tensor metrics with convex-hull geometric metrics.

Log of Activities:

Abstract Draft and Snapshot Data Analysis

Drafted abstract including number of snapshots and specific snapshot numbers.

Decided to express events in physical time (Gyr) instead of snapshot indices.

Noted convex-hull volume contraction (~1.5%) and differences between inertia-tensor vs convex-hull evolution.

Author Information and Credentials

Added academic credential under name: BS, University of Arizona, Astronomy.

Formatted author and affiliation for RNAAS submission.

Figure Placement and LaTeX Structure

Evaluated figure placement; initially pushed figure to the end of the manuscript.

Explored placement options and figure width adjustments for integration.

Two-Column Manuscript Conversion

Updated LaTeX document class to [RNAAS,twocolumn]{aastex631}.

Adjusted figure width to \columnwidth for inline display.

Verified abstract, sections, and equations displayed correctly in two-column format.

Methodology Section Refinement

Included details of MW–M31 N-body simulations.

Added number of snapshots and simulation output interval (Δt ≈ 0.0143 Gyr).

Included inertia tensor formulas and convex hull volume calculations.

Results Section Revision

Expressed results using physical time markers instead of snapshots:

Volume contraction ~1.5%

Hull-to-Ellipsoid ratio peak ~4.6 Gyr

Stepwise axis ratio changes ~2.9 Gyr and ~6.4 Gyr

Revised bullet points for clarity in two-column format.

Discussion Section

Highlighted complementarity of convex-hull and inertia-tensor metrics.

Emphasized convex-hull sensitivity to outer-shell particle rearrangements.

Conclusions Section

Drafted three key conclusions regarding volume contraction, core sphericity, and axis ratio diagnostics.

Acknowledgments and Software Citation

Added acknowledgments for HST simulation data and University of Arizona support.

Included software citations for matplotlib, numpy, python, and The Software Citation Station.

Final Verification and Integration

Ensured figure integration in the manuscript text, not at the end.

Checked two-column formatting for abstract, sections, equations, figures, and references.

Confirmed compliance with RNAAS style and word count limits.

Final PDF ready for submission with professional formatting.

Summary of Accomplishments:

Refined abstract and converted snapshot-based metrics to physical time (Gyr).

Added author credentials and formatted affiliations properly.

Converted manuscript to two-column layout.

Integrated figure inline with text using appropriate width.

Verified methodology, results, discussion, and conclusions for clarity and RNAAS compliance.

Added software citations and acknowledgments.

Final manuscript ready for submission.
