# MW–M31 Halo Analysis – 2025-12-23

## Overview
Today, I ran the MW–M31 halo analysis pipeline and documented the workflow. The goal was to analyze halo shape evolution and angular entropy across merger snapshots, and create a comprehensive guide for the pipeline.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Halo Shape Evolution Analysis**
   - Computed:
     - Mass-weighted inertia tensor axis ratios (b/a, c/a)
     - Convex hull axis ratios (b/a, c/a)
     - Convex hull volume
     - Ellipsoidal volume from inertia eigenvalues
     - Volume inflation factor (convex hull / ellipsoid)
   - Generated plots:
     - `halo_axis_ratio_comparison.png`
     - `halo_hull_volume.png`
     - `halo_volume_inflation.png`

2. **Angular Entropy Analysis**
   - Computed normalized angular Shannon entropy per radial shell for each snapshot.
   - Radial bins: logarithmic from 0.1–~400 kpc (40 bins)
   - Angular bins: n_theta = 12 (polar), n_phi = 24 (azimuthal)
   - Generated heatmap:
     - `angular_entropy_halo_evolution.png`

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `Guide to Pipeline.txt` containing:
     - Detailed explanations of Python libraries used (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy ConvexHull, CenterOfMass2)
     - Python functions and constructs (`np.arange`, `np.zeros`, `np.concatenate`, `f-strings`, etc.)
     - Custom functions and their purposes
     - Workflow summaries for both scripts
     - Physical interpretation of outputs (axis ratios, volumes, angular entropy)

## Notes
- Convex hull analysis provides a mass-independent view of halo geometry.
- Volume inflation factor highlights deviations from ellipsoidal symmetry.
- Angular entropy tracks isotropy vs. anisotropy in particle distribution across radial shells.
- The pipeline is now fully documented and reproducible for future analyses.

## Files Generated Today
- `halo_axis_ratio_comparison.png`
- `halo_hull_volume.png`
- `halo_volume_inflation.png`
- `angular_entropy_halo_evolution.png`
- `Guide to Pipeline.txt`
- `Pipeline.ipynb`

## Next Steps
- Analyze correlations between convex hull irregularities and angular entropy.
- Compare halo shape and entropy evolution across early vs. late merger snapshots.
- Start writing a research note and work towards getting this pipeline and my results published.
