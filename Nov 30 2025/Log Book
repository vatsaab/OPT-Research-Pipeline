Ran into catastrophic issues with Anaconda, debugged conda packages. 
Reinstalled Windows on my system and installed Anaconda Navigator. Pushed a screenshot of the Anaconda Navigator to this folder up and running as proof of successful installation.
Created the Jupyter Notebook "HaloShape.py" and pushed it to the repository. 
Ran the code in "HaloShape.py" for the merger snapshot and found my first result for the pipeline: determining the shape of the dark matter halo in the merger snapshots for M31 and MW. I found that the halo has a spherical shape.
