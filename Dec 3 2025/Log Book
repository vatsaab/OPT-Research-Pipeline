Tasks: Halo Density Analysis of MW + M31

Files / Code Written:

HaloDensityEvolution.py

Prepared code to compute radial density profiles for MW+M31 snapshots from 100 to 800.

Uses a shell-based method to calculate densities in logarithmic radial bins.

Includes progress printing to track snapshot processing.

Intended output: heatmap of density evolution (plotting code included but not executed).

HaloDensityProfile.py

Prepared code to calculate the density profile for a single snapshot (445).

Comparison with analytic profiles: Hernquist, NFW, and Isothermal.

Plotting code included but plots not generated yet.

HaloDifferentialDensity.py

Prepared code to compute differential density profile using the enclosed mass method for snapshot 445.

Includes calculation of cumulative mass, radial differences, and corresponding density.

Plotting code included but plots not generated yet.

Execution / Runtime Notes:

Code written to handle multiple snapshots and single-snapshot analysis.

Estimated runtime for full multi-snapshot execution (100–800) with plotting: several hours, likely ~3 hours if executed sequentially for all snapshots.

Code includes progress tracking for easier monitoring once executed.

Observations / Notes:

Code now prepared for full density analysis of MW+M31 halo.

Ready for plotting and analysis once executed.

Differential and analytic profile comparisons will allow verification of halo structure.

Next Steps:

Execute the scripts to generate heatmaps and density profile plots.

Verify correctness of density calculations and compare with analytic models.

Optimize runtime for multi-snapshot analysis if needed.
