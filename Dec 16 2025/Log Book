Hours Worked: 8 hours 
Hours include the time spent doing code development, debugging, compilation, and monitoring the long-running simulation.

Tasks Completed:
- Developed Python code to compute the gravitational potential energy of the MW+M31 halo merger snapshot.
- Implemented a cumulative potential energy calculation using cKDTree for efficiency.
- Added progress tracking to monitor how many particles were processed in real time.
- Ran the simulation for one merger snapshot (~50,000 particles) and generated a cumulative potential energy graph.
- Monitored code execution and ensured correctness of all calculations.

Files Generated:
- Notebook: PotentialEnergyMergerSnapshot.ipynb
- Plot: potential_energy_progress_snapshot.png

Description of Work:
- The code computes the gravitational potential energy incrementally for all particles.
- Progressively accumulates potential energy contributions from particle pairs.
- The code prints updates to show the percentage of particles processed to ensure active monitoring.

Graph Generated:
- The plot shows the cumulative absolute potential energy (|U|) as a function of the number of particles processed.
- The curve increases and gradually levels off as more particles are included, indicating convergence toward the total potential energy of the snapshot.
- Initial contributions are small, but the cumulative energy rises steadily, showing how the merger’s gravitational interactions build up as more particles are considered.
- This graph is useful for verifying convergence and understanding the energy distribution during the merger snapshot.
