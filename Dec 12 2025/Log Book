Hours Worked: 8 hours
Time Spent:
- Code writing: 0.5 hours
- Execution and monitoring: 7.5 hours
- Total: 8 hours

Task:
Attempted to compute kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and virial ratio 2K/|U| for the combined MW–M31 halo system across ~800 simulation snapshots.

Work Done:
- Wrote analysis code to read MW and M31 particle data, combine halos, shift to the MW center-of-mass frame, and compute energies.
- Implemented direct particle–particle gravitational potential energy using an O(N^2) double sum, storing results for each snapshot.
- Actively monitored code execution to check for errors, ensuring proper simulation behavior.

Result:
- Snapshot 0 completed successfully.
- Notebook failed on snapshot 1 after ~7.5 hours of runtime due to an OSError ([Errno 22] Invalid argument), likely caused by the computationally infeasible O(N^2) approach in Jupyter.

File generated: VirialRatioAttempt.ipynb

Next Step:
- Redesign the potential energy calculation using a computationally tractable approximation (e.g., Barnes–Hut or particle-mesh method) to process all snapshots efficiently.
