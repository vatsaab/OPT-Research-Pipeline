Hours Worked - 8 hours
Time Spent:
- Code writing: 30 minutes
- Execution: 27,000 seconds (7.5 hours)
- Total: 8 hours

Task:
Attempted to compute kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and virial ratio 2K/|U| for the combined MW–M31 halo system across ~800 simulation snapshots.

Work Done:
- Wrote analysis code to read MW and M31 particle data, combine halos, shift to the MW center-of-mass frame, and compute energies.
- Implemented direct particle–particle gravitational potential energy using an O(N^2) double sum and stored results for each snapshot.

Result:
- Snapshot 0 completed successfully.
- The notebook failed on snapshot 1 after ~7.5 hours of runtime with an OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument, likely due to the computationally infeasible O(N^2) approach combined with long-running execution in Jupyter.

File generated: VirialRatioAttempt.ipynb

Next Step:
- Redesign the potential energy calculation using a computationally tractable approximation.
