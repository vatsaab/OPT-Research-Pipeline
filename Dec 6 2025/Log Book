Hours worked: 4 hours
Task: Galaxy Density Profile Analysis

Summary:
Fixed syntax errors in the density profile code and added snapshot processing progress printing.

Ran the full radial density computation for MW and M31 snapshots (0–600) using multiple methods: Enclosed Mass, KDE, Nearest-Neighbor, Octree, and Delaunay tessellation.

The code was executed in a Jupyter notebook named DensityPlots.py.

Total runtime was approximately 3 hours for all 601 snapshots.

Generated heatmap plots of density evolution for each method, showing radial density changes across snapshots.

All plots were saved and included in the notebook.

Files Created / Updated:

DensityPlots.py → contains the full code and generated plots.

Output images saved: density_methods_evolution_heatmaps.png.

Observations / Notes:

Snapshot processing averaged ~10–15 seconds per snapshot.

Octree and Delaunay methods were the most time-consuming steps.

The notebook has been uploaded to the folder containing this logbook.

Next Steps:

Consider optimizing Octree/Delaunay computations for faster runtime.

Analyze generated density evolution plots to identify trends in MW-M31 system.
