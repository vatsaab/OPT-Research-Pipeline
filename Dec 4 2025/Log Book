Code and uploaded HaloDensityProfile.py to this folder.
Density Profile Methods Implementation:-
Implemented full suite of five independent halo-density estimation methods for combined MW+M31 simulations:
KDE / SPH-like smoothing using Gaussian kernels with mass-weighted contributions.
Nearest-neighbor density estimator using adaptive volumes based on the 32nd nearest particle.
Adaptive octree mesh with recursive spatial subdivision, mass-per-cell estimates, and radial binning.
Delaunay tessellation density estimation via tetrahedral volumes and centroid binning.
Enclosed-mass differential density using cumulative mass profile and shell differentiation.

Coded and uploaded HaloDensityEvolution2.py to this folder. 
Time-Evolution Density Pipeline Implementation:-
Pipeline now:
Reads MW and M31 files for each index.
Computes center-of-mass shift, concatenates halos, and processes particle data.
Computes KDE, NN, Octree, Delaunay, and Enclosed-Mass densities for each snapshot.
Stores results in time×radius matrices for all methods.
Generates evolution heatmaps showing log-density as a function of snapshot and radius.
Added robust fallback handling for missing snapshots, Delaunay failures, and edge-case bins.
