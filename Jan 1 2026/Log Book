Log Book – Research Activities

Reviewed existing RNAAS draft for MW–M31 halo note.

Identified figure placement issue: axis ratio figure appeared after references and took a full page.

Modified LaTeX to move figure immediately after Quickhull equation in Convex Hull section.

Rewrote Methodology section:

Clarified that inertia tensor eigenvalues are a proxy for halo shape, not exact ellipsoid axes.

Described Convex Hull as a geometric measure of halo boundary, sensitive to outer-shell particles.

Defined dimensionless structural index $R$ as relative measure of morphology rather than literal volume ratio.

Added note on sensitivity to extreme particles explaining stepwise axis ratio changes.

Removed Results section to streamline RNAAS note.

Replaced Conclusions section with Implications section summarizing broader significance of metrics.

Added one concluding sentence to Discussions section to wrap up analysis.

Renamed Discussions section to “Halo Morphology Implications” for specificity.

Added corresponding author information on bottom left of first page:

Verified LaTeX compiles correctly in two-column RNAAS layout with figure inline.

Ensured all equations, notes, and section headers are correctly positioned and consistent.

Outcome: Manuscript is technically accurate, visually coherent, methodology clearly explained, figure integrated, and ready for RNAAS submission.
